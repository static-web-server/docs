# Overview

**Static Web Server (SWS)** is a fast and efficient, open-source web server for serving static files and web assets. Built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), it combines high performance with memory safety. No garbage collector, no runtime overhead, just a single `~4MB` binary that runs everywhere.

SWS is designed to be **simple by default, powerful when needed**. You can point it at a folder and go with zero configuration, or tune every aspect through CLI flags, environment variables, or a TOML config file.

> [!INFO] Major v3 upgrade
>
> If you use SWS v2 and want to upgrade, check out [the v3 migration guide](./migration-guide.md).
